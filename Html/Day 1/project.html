    <h2>Who is Frontend Developer?</h2>

    <p>A Front-End Developer is a type of web developer who focuses on the user interface and user experience aspects of web applications. They are responsible for designing and implementing the visual elements that users interact with directly in their web browsers. Front-End Developers work with technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and visually appealing websites and web applications.
        <br>
        <br>
        Their primary goal is to ensure that the website or application is user-friendly, accessible, and functions smoothly across different devices and browsers. Front-End Developers often collaborate with designers, back-end developers, and other stakeholders to bring a cohesive and engaging user experience to life.
     they may also use front-end frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js to streamline development and enhance the functionality of web applications.
